# Credit Card Approval Prediction

Welcome to the Credit Card Approval Prediction project! This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the approval of credit card applications based on various applicant attributes. This is a hands-on project that explores feature engineering, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in the domain of financial services.

## Project Overview

Credit card approval is an important process for financial institutions. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project builds a predictive model that helps in deciding whether an application should be approved or rejected based on various features like age, income, credit score, and more.

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline, including:
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and tuning
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about past credit card applications. Each row in the dataset represents an applicant's details, including their demographic information, financial status, and credit history.

- **Target Variable**: `Approved` (binary)
- **Input Features**: Various features such as income, credit score, employment status, etc.

*Note*: The dataset is preprocessed for demonstration purposes. You can find more details in the `data/` directory.

## Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.
- Encoding categorical features using label encoding and one-hot encoding.
- Normalizing or scaling numerical features.
- Dealing with class imbalance (if applicable).

These steps ensure the data is in the right format for model training.

## Modeling

Several machine learning algorithms were tested to build the best-performing model, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- XGBoost

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using grid search and cross-validation to optimize model performance.

## Evaluation

The performance of the models was evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC score

We used these metrics to choose the best model that balances precision and recall, considering the impact of false positives and false negatives in real-world scenarios.

## Installation

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/3m0r9/credit-card-approval-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd credit-card-approval-prediction
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Once the environment is set up, you can start by running the notebook or scripts provided for data preprocessing and model training.

2. To run the model training script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. Model predictions can be generated by running the `predict.py` script with a set of new applicant data:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input new_applicant_data.csv
   ```

## Results

The final model achieved the following performance metrics on the test set:
- **Accuracy**: 85%
- **Precision**: 0.82
- **Recall**: 0.84
- **F1-score**: 0.83
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.88

Detailed results and analysis can be found in the `results/` directory.
